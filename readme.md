# SplitViewBundle for Pimcore 11

This Bundle allows opening multiple Objects in the Pimcore ExtJs Admin UI. Ideal, for the use with one ultrawide monitor without opening multiple Pimcore instances.

The installation follows the standard Symfony/Pimcore-Bundle installation procedure. 
(composer install and enable class in bundles.php)

### Prerequisites: 
- Pimcore â‰¥ 11.4

> composer require watza/splitviewbundle

bundles.php:
Add "Watza\SplitViewBundle\WatzaSplitViewBundle::class => ['all' => true]," to return Array.

## How to Use
To open the Splitview, run the following in the browser console using your desired Pimcore IDs:
> new pimcore.object.splitview($id1, $id2);

Second method: Right click on an Object in the tabbar to add it to SplitView Tab
